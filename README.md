# My nvim config

Quickly setup my exact neovim config without any compromises in a few easy steps.

## Installation guide (for the ultimate noob)

### If you are on Windows:
- Download neovim from [github](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.5.0), or use a package manager like [choco](https://chocolatey.org/)
- if you already have an `init.vim` config, backup it before proceeding.
- run the following command from cmd or powershell or bash or any other prompt you like. :sweat_smile:
```git
git clone https://github.com/hgup/nvim ~/appdata/local/nvim
```
- run nvim, and spam `enter` to get rid of all the errors.
- [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) will automatically install all the required plugins.
- After having done that, just restart nvim and Kudos. :tada:

### If you are on Linux:

```

- [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) will automatically install all the required plugins.
- and you are done. Restart to view effects.
